/// A meter behind a USB HID "serial" cable.
///
/// These cables enumerate as HID devices rather than serial ports. Three
/// chips are known (Chip):
///  - WCH CH9325 / Hoitek HE2325U (UT-D04 and older UNI-T cables, many
///    others): the UART speed is set with a feature report, the meter's
///    bytes then arrive in 8-byte input reports (0xF0 | count, up to 7
///    payload bytes with the top bit set).
///  - Silicon Labs CP2110 (UNI-T UT-D09 first revision, 10c4:ea80): UART
///    enabled and configured with two feature reports (0x41, 0x50), data in
///    reports whose id is the byte count (1..63). Per sigrok's
///    serial_hid_cp2110.c / SiLabs AN434.
///  - WCH CH9329 in custom-HID mode (UNI-T UT-D09 second revision,
///    1a86:e429): a plain UART tunnel, fixed 9600 8N1, no feature report,
///    64-byte input reports (count, then up to 63 raw bytes). Layout per
///    sigrok PR #298.
///  - Brymen BU-86X infrared adapter (0820:0001): raw 8-byte reports that
///    are nothing but UART bytes, fixed speed, no configuration. The meter
///    only answers to a request (DmmDecoder::pollRequest()), so this is the
///    one cable QtDMM writes to.
/// Both UT-D09 revisions look alike; lsusb tells them apart.
/// A HidReader in its own thread blocks in hid_read_timeout() and hands each
/// report over as a queued signal; this object stays in the main thread,
/// unpacks the UART bytes into a buffer and serves ReaderThread through
/// readData()/bytesAvailable() with readyRead(). The line configuration
/// (feature reports) is sent in the constructor, so a cable that refuses it
/// fails open() at once.
/// The blocking hidapi read loop, living in its own thread. It owns the
/// handle from the moment run() starts until the loop ends, so hid_close()
/// happens exactly once, in the thread that reads. Reports go to
/// HIDSerialDevice as queued signals; nothing is shared.
